//    1. What is J2EE?
//J2EE is an environment for developing and deploying enterprise applications. 
//The J2EE platform consists of a set of services, application programming interfaces (APIs), and protocols that provide the functionality 
//for developing multitiered, web-based applications.
//
//2. What is the J2EE module?
//A J2EE module consists of one or more J2EE components for the same container type and one component deployment descriptor of that type.
//
//3. What are the components of J2EE application? 
//A J2EE component is a self-contained functional software unit that is assembled into 
//a J2EE application with its related classes and files and communicates with other components. 
//The J2EE specification defines the following J2EE components:
//Application clients and applets are client components.
//Java Servlet and JavaServer PagesTM (JSPTM) technology components are web components.
//Enterprise JavaBeansTM (EJBTM) components (enterprise beans) are business components.
//Resource adapter components provided by EIS and tool vendors.
//4. What are the four types of J2EE modules?
//
//1. Application client module
//2. Web module
//3. Enterprise JavaBeans module
//4. Resource adapter module
//
// 21. Difference between char and nvarchar / char and varchar data-type?
//char[(n)] - Fixed-length non-Unicode character data with length of n bytes. n must be a value from 1 through 8,000. Storage size is n bytes.
//nvarchar(n) - Variable-length Unicode character data of n characters. n must be a value from 1 through 4,000. Storage size, in bytes, is two times the number of characters entered. The data entered can be 0 characters in length
//varchar[(n)] - Variable-length non-Unicode character data with length of n bytes. n must be a value from 1 through 8,000. Storage size is the actual length in bytes of the data entered, not n bytes. The data entered can be 0 characters in length.
//22. GUID datasize?
//128 bit.
//23. How GUID becoming unique across machines?
//To ensure uniqueness across machines, the ID of the network card is used (among others) to compute the number.
//24. What is the difference between text and image data type?
//Text and image. Use text for character data if you need to store more than 255 characters in SQL Server 6.5, or more than 8000 in SQL Server 7.0. Use image for binary large objects (BLOBs) such as digital images. With text and image data types, the data is not stored in the row, so the limit of the page size does not apply.All that is stored in the row is a pointer to the database pages that contain the data.Individual text, ntext, and image values can be a maximum of 2-GB, which is too long to store in a single data row.
//25. What are joins?
//Sometimes we have to select data from two or more tables to make our result complete. We have to perform a join.
//26. How many types of Joins?
//
//Joins can be categorized as:
//Inner joins (the typical join operation, which uses some comparison operator like = or <>). These include equi-joins and natural joins.
//Inner joins use a comparison operator to match rows from two tables based on the values in common columns from each table. For example, retrieving all rows where the student identification number is the same in both the students and courses tables.
//Outer joins. Outer joins can be a left, a right, or full outer join.
//Outer joins are specified with one of the following sets of keywords when they are specified in the FROM clause:
//LEFT JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN -The result set of a left outer join includes all the rows from the left table specified in the LEFT OUTER clause, not just the ones in which the joined columns match. When a row in the left table has no matching rows in the right table, the associated result set row contains null values for all select list columns coming from the right table.
//RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN - A right outer join is the reverse of a left outer join. All rows from the right table are returned. Null values are returned for the left table any time a right table row has no matching row in the left table.
//FULL JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN - A full outer join returns all rows in both the left and right tables. Any time a row has no match in the other table, the select list columns from the other table contain null values. When there is a match between the tables, the entire result set row contains data values from the base tables.
//Cross joins - Cross joins return all rows from the left table, each row from the left table is combined with all rows from the right table. Cross joins are also called Cartesian products. (A Cartesian join will get you a Cartesian product. A Cartesian join is when you join every row of one table to every row of another table. You can also get one by joining every row of a table to every row of itself.)
//27. What is self join?
//A table can be joined to itself in a self-join.
//28. What are the differences between UNION and JOINS?
//A join selects columns from 2 or more tables.
//A union selects rows.
//29. Can I improve performance by using the ANSI-style joins instead of the old-style joins?
//Code Example 1:
//select o.name, i.name
//from sysobjects o, sysindexes i
//where o.id = i.id
//
//Code Example 2:
//select o.name, i.name
//from sysobjects o inner join sysindexes i
//on o.id = i.id
//You will not get any performance gain by switching to the ANSI-style JOIN syntax.
//Using the ANSI-JOIN syntax gives you an important advantage: Because the join logic is cleanly separated from the filtering criteria, you can understand the query logic more quickly.
//The SQL Server old-style JOIN executes the filtering conditions before executing the joins, whereas the ANSI-style JOIN reverses this procedure (join logic precedes filtering).
//Perhaps the most compelling argument for switching to the ANSI-style JOIN is that Microsoft has explicitly stated that SQL Server will not support the old-style OUTER JOIN syntax indefinitely. Another important consideration is that the ANSI-style JOIN supports query constructions that the old-style JOIN syntax does not support.
//30. What is derived table?
//Derived tables are SELECT statements in the FROM clause referred to by an alias or a user-specified name. The result set of the SELECT in the FROM clause forms a table used by the outer SELECT statement. For example, this SELECT uses a derived table to find if any store carries all book titles in the pubs database:
//SELECT ST.stor_id, ST.stor_name
//FROM stores AS ST,
//(SELECT stor_id, COUNT(DISTINCT title_id) AS title_count
//FRoM Sales
//GROUP BY stor_id
//)AS SA
//WHERE ST.stor_id = SA.stor_id
//AND SA.title_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titles) 
    
// Abstract Classes: Classes which cannot be instantiated. This means one cannot make a object of this 
   // class or in other way cannot create object by saying ClassAbs abs = new ClassAbs(); where ClassAbs is abstract class.
//Abstract classes contains have one or more abstarct methods, ie method body only no implementation.
//Interfaces: These are same as abstract classes only difference is we can only define method definition and no implementation.
//When to use wot depends on various reasons. One being design choice.
//One reason for using abstarct classes is we can code common
//functionality and force our developer to use it. I can have a complete
//class but I can still mark the class as abstract.
//Developing by interface helps in object based communication.
